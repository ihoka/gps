This is just a really basic script to allow for less typing when wanting to search through output from the `ps' command. So, instead of running `ps -ef | grep foo' you can just run `gps foo' and get basically the same output. The output will be different from the longer command in the following ways:

* gps will attempt to make sure the column headers show up in the results
* gps will attempt to hide itself from the output
* gps uses some explicit columns for the output from ps so the actual columns available will be different than either `ps -ef' or `ps aux'

Currently the columns that gps is using are:

USER       PID  PPID     STIME   TT  STAT COMMAND
